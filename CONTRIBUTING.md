Important: Branching Workflow

1. Each member must work on their own branch. This is mandatory to ensure smooth website development.


2. Compare your branch to the production branch after making your changes.


3. The team lead will compare changes from production to the sub-main branch.


4. The project lead will finally merge changes from sub-main to the main branch.



This flow ensures that the website remains stable and runs smoothly.
